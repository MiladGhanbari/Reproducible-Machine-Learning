# Reproducible-Machine-Learning
The main goal of this project is of reproducing the results of a machine learning paper followed by proposing some possible modifications for improving the performance of the baseline model. The method proposed in the main paper is called Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DensNet). Reducing the vanishing-gradient problem, reinforcing feature propagation and feature reuse are some of the benefits of DenseNet. After introducing the main model and duplicating some of the results from the original paper, the performance of the model is investigated by manipulating some key hyperparameters including learning rate, number of layers and growth rate. Three modifications are proposed for achieving higher performance, and evaluation of these modified models on image databases (CFAR10 and CFAR100) verified the increase in the performance but with the cost of more parameters.
